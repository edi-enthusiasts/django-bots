**Why is it called 'bots'? Where are the bots?**
    | EDI is about cooperation in the supply chain (collaboration, tying together, etc). That is true, but on the other hand it is also a clash of cultures. In Dutch **bots** is like **crash**.
    | **bots** is also the nickname my grandfather-in-law used for my girlfriend. It was not clear where that name came from, probably that was how she pronouced her name (betsy) when she learned to talk.
    | In Dutch **bots** is singular.
