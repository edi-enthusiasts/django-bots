EDI Basics
==========

A high level introduction to EDI - business process focused

High Level EDI Business Flow
----------------------------

    Various documents need to be exchanged during the lifecycle of a business transaction. A generic flow is shown below, this focuses on the business processes, not a particular EDI implementation (we'll get to that later).

    There may be other communication, for example business process/contracts may dictate that all changes are requested and approved by email prior to the ERP systems being modified.

    **Example Business Flow**

    * Buyer (customer) creates a purchase order (PO)
    * PO is sent to supplier via EDI
    * Supplier loads a Sale Order in response to the PO, with optional changes.
    * Supplier acknowledges PO (with any changes)
    * Buyer changes quantity of a line (part)
    * Buyer-initiated Change Request is sent to supplier via EDI
    * Supplier implements or rejects changes
    * Supplier sends summary of changes/rejects to buyer via EDI
    * Supplier needs to delete a line as they can no longer supply
    * Supplier sends supplier-initiated change request to buyer/customer via EDI
    * Buyer receives change request and implement or rejects changes
    * Supplier ships material
    * Supplier sends an Advance Ship Notice (shipping manifest) via EDI
    * Supplier sends invoice via EDI

Typical EDI Document Types

    The Purchase Order Acknowledge is sent from supplier to buyer. It confirms acceptance of the buyer's Purchase Order along with any changes required by the supplier (for example pricing or scheduled delivery dates).
