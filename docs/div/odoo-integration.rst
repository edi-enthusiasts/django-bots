Integration with Odoo/OpenERP
=============================

Bots can add EDI support to Odoo (previously OpenERP).

.. note::
    The standard Odoo EDI module only transfers data between two Odoo installations and is NOT X12, EDIFACT or similar EDI.

To do:

* High Level Business Flow
* The Odoo XMLRPC interface
* The bots_connector module
* Example script - Sending an X12 810 invoice
* Example script - Creating a sale order from X12 850 purchase order
