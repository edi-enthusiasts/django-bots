Bots 2.2.0
==========

Migration notes
---------------

    **Procedure**

    * Update plugin:
        #. Get the plugin at `sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/bots%20open%20source%20edi%20software/2.2.0>`_.
        #. Mind there are 2 version of the plugin, depending upon the version of django you use.
        #. Read like a normal plugin (``bots-monitor->systasks->read plugin``).
        #. Bots-monitor will give an error...nasty but upgrade is done.
        #. Stop the web-server.
        #. Edit ``bots/config/settings.py`` (See below)
        #. Restart bots-webserver.
    * For windows:
        #. Get the installer at sourceforge.
        #. Install new version.
            * Django is upgraded to 1.3.1
            * Database and mappings are not changed
            * Configuration files have not been changed
        #. Edit ``bots/config/settings.py`` (See below)
    
    **For all updates**: ``settings.py`` HAS to be changed. One line has to be added (at end of file):

    .. code-block:: python

        TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
            "django.core.context_processors.auth",
            "django.core.context_processors.debug",
            "django.core.context_processors.i18n",
            "django.core.context_processors.media",
            "django.core.context_processors.request",
            "bots.bots_context.set_context",    #THIS LINE IS ADDED
        )

    **Compatibility**

    Version 2.2.0 is upward compatible with previous versions in 2.*.*-series:

    * no data migration needed
    * grammars, translations etc mostly will work as before

    **Compatibility problems**

    #. when upgrading from 2.0.* see :doc:`migration to 2.1.0 <bots210>`
    #. as mentioned above: new line has to be added in ``settings.py`` in ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``

    **Deprecated**

    #. django 1.1.*; use django > 1.2.0, see for :doc:`instructions <migrate-django>`
    #. editype: database (=database connector with SQLalchemy). Use editype db; if wished you can use SQLalchemy in this new database connector.
    #. code conversion via file (in bots/usersys/codeconversions). Use codeconversion via ccode table: better, faster, more flexible.
    #. editype template (with library 'kid'); use editype template-html (with library Genshi) instead. Genshi is quite simular to kid, see for :doc:`instructions <migrate-kid>`
    #. communication via intercommit (type intercommit). If needed, a plugin can be provided.

Changes
-------

    **Changes in bots.ini**

    You can use your old bots.ini with no problem, reasonable defaults have been used. New options added in 2.2.0:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [webserver]

        #settings for logging of bots-webserver
        #console logging on (True) or off (False); default is True.
        webserver_log_console = True
        #webserver_log_console_level: level for logging to console/screen. Values: DEBUG,INFO,STARTINFO,WARNING,ERROR or CRITICAL. Default: STARTINFO 
        #actually useful: WARNING: only start-up text; info gives more info
        webserver_log_console_level = STARTINFO

        # to customise name of botslogo html file (default: bots/botslogo.html)
        botslogo = bots/botslogo.html
        # text displayed on right of bots logo. Useful to indicate different environments: TEST, PRODUCTION. Default: no text
        environment_text = 

        #when True, the run menu contains entries to run each route indivudually. Default: False
        menu_all_routes = False

        [custommenus]
        #it is possible to add a custom menu to the default bots menu. Features
        #1. the menuname to appear on the menu bar in bots monitor; Default: Custom. Eg:
        #menuname = MyMenu
        #2. Entries ins the custom menu: all "name: value" entries in this section will be added to the custom menu in bots monitor. Eg:
        #Incoming = /incoming/?all
        #3. Menu divider lines can be added with special value "---". Eg:
        #divider1 = ---
        # note: sequence of entries is preserved, but case of menu entry is not; title case will be applied
