Walk through setup
==================

Lets take a look at the setup in ``my_first_plugin``.

**Look at the configured route**

To view the route configured: ``bots-monitor->Configuration->Routes``. This will look like: 

.. image:: ../images/StartRoutes.png

* A route tells bots what to do: where to get the edi-files, what type of files these are (this determines the translation done), and where to put the translated edi-files..
* One route is configured, called ``myfirstfoute``.
* The route uses communication channel ``myfirstroute_in`` to get incoming edi-files.
* These are edifact format: fromeditype=edifact, frommessagetype=edifact. Bots will figure out the exact messagetype (like ORDERSD96AUN) by itself.
* The translated edi-files (fixed format) go to communication channel ``myfirstroute_out``.

**View the communication channels**

To view the communication channels configured: ``bots-monitor->Configuration->Channels``. This will look like: 

.. image:: ../images/StartChannels.png

* A communications channel communicates edi-files in or out of bots.
* There are different types of channels, eg: file, ftp, smtp, pop3, etc.
* In this plugin 2 routes are configured. Both are type ``file``: all reading and writing is to file system.
* There is one ``in``-channel and one ``out``-channel.
* Channels for file-system require a path and a filename.

**The translations in this configuration**

To view the translations configured: ``bots-monitor->Configuration->Translations``. This will look like:

.. image:: ../images/StartTranslations.png

* There is one :doc:`translation <../configuration/translation/index>` configured.
* This translation translates edi messages of editype ``edifact`` and messagetype ``ORDERSD96AUNEAN008`` using mappingscript 
  ``myfirstscriptordersedi2fixed`` to edi messages of editype ``fixed`` and messagetype ``ordersfixed``.
* Each messagetype has a :doc:`grammar <../configuration/grammars/index>` which describes the message: records, fields, formats. The grammar is a file; you can find it in: ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\bots\usersys\grammars\fixed``
* The :doc:`mapping script <../configuration/mapping-scripts/index>` does the actual translation; basically it gets data from the incoming message and puts the data in the outgoing message. 
* The mapping script is a file; you can find it in: ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\bots\usersys\mappings\edifact``
